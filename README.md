# Bayesian-Networks

**The code contained in this repository performs inference on coronary artery desease data using bayesian networks**

The code in bayesian_networks.Rmd performs the following tasks: 

1) Describe the dataset 
2) Identify a blacklist
3) Learn the optimal structure of the bayesian network using score-based, constraint-based and hybrid methods, as well as model averaging
4) Perform inference using bayesian networks
5) Perform inference using a naive bayesian and a tree-augmented naive bayesian classifier

The file bayesian_networks.html contains an explanation of the tasks performed and of the results obtained.
